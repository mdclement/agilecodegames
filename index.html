				<blockquote><p>Learn how to play with code: how to make mistakes, how to improvise, how to reflect, and how to measure. This is hard: we’re trained to try to do things right, to play to the score, rather than improvise.</p><p align="right">-Dave Thomas</p></blockquote>

				<h2>What is an agile code game?</h2>
				<p>In the agile community we often use games to teach and learn agile concepts.  Sites such as <a href="http://tastycupcakes.org/">Tasty Cupcakes</a> catalog many of the games that we use to learn.</p>
				<p><a href="http://agilegames2013.com/">Agile Games</a> is a conference dedicated to exploring concepts such as serious play, collaboration and experiential learning. I attended last year and had a wonderful time. The only thing I came disappointed with was the lack of emphasis on coding. Most of the agile games were focused on software development processes (which are very important) and only one session was on agile coding practices.</p>
